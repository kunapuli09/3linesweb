                     IMPORTANT INFORMATION & DISCLOSURES
This presentation is strictly confidential and may not be reproduced, disclosed to or otherwise provided in any format, in whole or in part, to any other person or entity (other than your professional advisors bound by obligations of confidentiality) without the prior written consent of 3Lines, LLC (“3Lines”). This presentation does not constitute an offer to sell, or the solicitation of any offer to purchase, an interest in 3Lines Rocket Fund, L.P. (“Fund II”) nor any of the funds managed by 3Lines in any jurisdiction. Any such offer or solicitation will be made only by means of a confidential private offering memorandum (“Memorandum”), which should be read carefully prior to making an investment.
An investment in Fund II is speculative and entails substantial risks, including the fact that such an investment would be illiquid and be subject to significant restrictions on transferability. No market is expected to develop for interests in Fund II. PAST OR PROJECTED PERFORMANCE IS NOT INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS. Investors should not assume that the performance of any specific investment or investment strategy will be profitable or equal to corresponding past performance levels. Any investment or investment strategy can be impacted by numerous factors, including market and economic conditions, which may result in a loss to investors.
Certain information contained in this presentation constitutes "forward‐looking statements," which can be identified by the use of forward‐looking terminology such as "may," "will," "should," "expect,“ "anticipate," "project," "estimate," "intend," "continue," "target," "believe," the negatives thereof, other variations thereon or comparable terminology. Due to various risks and uncertainties inherent in the markets or otherwise facing the asset management industry, actual events or results or the actual performance of Fund II may differ materially from those reflected or contemplated in such forward‐looking statements. Prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements.
The portfolio, which is under the sole investment authority of 3Lines, is a venture capital strategy and this lack of diversification may result in higher risk. An investor should not make an investment, unless it is prepared to lose all or a substantial portion of its investment. The fees and expenses charged in connection with this investment may be substantial and higher than the fees and expenses of other investment alternatives and may offset profits.
The investment opportunities discussed or referenced herein may not be suitable for all investors, and potential investors must make an independent assessment of the appropriateness of any transaction in light of their own objectives and circumstances, including the possible risk and benefits of entering into such a transaction.
The reader is urged to read the sections in the Memorandum addressing risk factors and conflicts of interest. This presentation is for informational purposes only and not to be relied upon as investment, legal, tax, or financial advice. Any investor must consult with his or her independent professional advisors as to the legal, tax, financial or other matters relevant to the suitability of an investment in the interests of Fund II. An investment in Fund II may not be suitable for all clients. The reader should consult its own advisers as to whether it is legally permissible for the reader to invest under applicable investment or similar laws or regulations. Investors who are U.S. persons must be "accredited investors" within the meaning of Rule 501(a) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The reader must also comply with all applicable laws and regulations in any jurisdiction in which he/she subscribes for an investment; and the reader, by acceptance of this presentation, agrees that 3Lines and Fund II will not have any responsibility for the reader’s compliance with such laws and regulations. No sale of fund interests will be made in any jurisdiction in which the offer, solicitation, or sale is not authorized or to any person to whom it is unlawful to make the offer, solicitation or sale.
In addition, because this communication is preliminary and only a high‐level summary; it does not contain all material terms pertinent to an investment decision, including important disclosures of conflicts and risk factors associated with an investment in Fund II. This presentation in and of itself should not form the basis for any investment decision. Any investment decision with respect to Fund II must be based solely on the definitive version of the Memorandum and other fund documents, such as the limited partnership agreement, investment management agreement, and subscription agreement(s) and related documentation for Fund II. In the event of any conflict between information contained herein and information contained in the Memorandum, the information in the Memorandum will control and supersede the information contained herein. There is no assurance that Fund II will achieve its investment objective or generate positive returns. Such an investment is speculative and entails substantial risk, including a risk of total loss of your investment. Returns generated from an investment in Fund II may not adequately compensate investors for the business and financial risks assumed. These materials have not been approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) or any other regulatory authority or securities commission. Fund II is not subject to the same regulatory requirements as mutual funds. 
Certain information contained herein has been acquired from published sources and from third parties, including without limitation, market forecasts, internal and external surveys, market research, publicly available information and industry publications. Although such information is believed to be reliable for the purposes used herein, neither Fund II nor 3Lines assumes any responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of such information, and information is subject to change without notice. Analyses and opinions contained herein may be based on assumptions that if altered can change the analyses or opinions expressed.
